      <h1>Sliding Puzzle Solver</h1>

      <p>
      You can slide tiles around in the puzzle below by clicking on them or by
      using the Scramble button. The right-hand side of the page shows the best
      possible solution to solve the puzzle, as precomputed by the
      <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/tuzz/sliding_puzzle">sliding_puzzle gem</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
      This page is served by a simple Rack application. A GET request can be
      made that encodes the current state of the puzzle. The response is an
      array of moves to solve it in the fewest moves. The URL for the current
      puzzle is <a target="_blank" id="encoding"></a>.
