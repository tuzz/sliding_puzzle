## Sliding Puzzle ##

A Ruby gem for manipulating and solving sliding tile puzzles.

**TODO - this gem is a work in progress**

### Overview ###

You might have come across sliding tile puzzles before. They're usually cheap,
plastic-y toys that can be rearranged by sliding their tiles around. Here's an
example containing a picture of a frog:

</p><br/>

One of the pieces is blank which means an adjacent tile can move into its place.
After repeating this a few times, these puzzles can be tricky to solve. We can
also think of these puzzles as grids of numbers:

</p><br/>

The challenge is to find a sequence of moves to rearrange the 'start state' into
the 'goal state' in as few moves as possible. This gem lets you play with these
puzzles and it solves them in an optimal number of moves.

In this example the blank is in the the upper-left corner of the goal state, but
it's arbitrary where it's located.

### Usage ###

Puzzles are represented as arrays of numbers:

```ruby
puzzle = SlidingPuzzle.new(
  [1, 2, 0], # <-- the 0 represents blank
  [3, 4, 5],
  [6, 7, 8],
)
```

You can slide tiles around and print the result:

```ruby
puzzle.slide!(:right)
puzzle.print
# [1, 0, 2]
# [3, 4, 5]
# [6, 7, 8]
```

The `#slide` method will return a new `SlidingPuzzle` whereas `#slide!` will
mutate the existing one.

### Moves ###

You can return an array of possible moves for a sliding puzzle:

```ruby
puzzle = SlidingPuzzle.new(
  [1, 2, 0],
  [3, 4, 5],
  [6, 7, 8],
)

puzzle.moves
#=> [:right, :up]
```

If you try a move that isn't valid, an error is raised:

```ruby
puzzle.slide(:left)
# SlidingPuzzle::InvalidMoveError, "unable to slide left"
```

### Scrambling ###

You can scramble a puzzle:

```ruby
puzzle.scramble!
```

By default, this will perform 100 random moves, but you can set this:

```ruby
puzzle.scramble!(moves: 3)
```

The `#scramble` method will return a new `SlidingPuzzle` whereas `#scramble!`
will mutate the existing one.

### Dimensions ###

Puzzles can have different dimensions:

```ruby
two_by_four = SlidingPuzzle.new(
  [1, 2, 3, 4],
  [5, 6, 7, 0],
)

two_by_four.slide!(:down)
two_by_four.print
# [1, 2, 3, 0]
# [5, 6, 7, 4]
```

Puzzles must be rectangular and contain a single blank.

### Solving ###

Finding the shortest solution for a sliding puzzle is
[a hard problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle#Solvability). This gem
provides 'oracles' to find these solutions:

```ruby
goal_state = SlidingPuzzle.new(
  [1, 2, 0],
  [3, 4, 5],
  [6, 7, 8],
)

oracle = SlidingPuzzle.oracle(goal_state)
```

This 'oracle' finds the shortest solution from any start state:

```ruby
start_state = SlidingPuzzle.new(
  [1, 4, 2],
  [3, 7, 5],
  [6, 0, 8],
)

oracle.solve(start_state)
#=> [:down, :down, :left]
```

### Oracles ###

Oracles aren't magic. They are the result of precomputing solutions in advance.
This gem provides oracles for puzzles with up to ten tiles:

```ruby
goal_state = SlidingPuzzle.new(
  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
  [6, 7, 0, 8, 9],
)

oracle = SlidingPuzzle.oracle(goal_state)
```

The numbers of the goal state must be sequential, but the blank can be anywhere.

The `#oracle` method will return `nil` for a puzzle with more than ten tiles, or
if the numbers aren't sequential.

### Impossible puzzles ###

Some starting positions are
[impossible to solve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle#Solvability). For
example, if you swap any two tiles from the goal state, there's no way to solve
the puzzle:

```ruby
unsolvable = SlidingPuzzle.new(
  [2, 1, 0],
  [3, 4, 5],
  [6, 7, 8],
)

oracle.solve(unsolvable)
#=> nil
```

In total, there are [N!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial) possible
configurations for a puzzle with N tiles (including the blank), but only half of
these are solvable.

For the 3x3 puzzle, there are 9! / 2 = 181,400 solvable configurations.

### Precomputing ###

For dimensions with no oracles, you can precompute your own:

```ruby
goal_state = SlidingPuzzle.new(
  [0, 1,  2, 3],
  [4, 5,  6, 7],
  [8, 9, 10, 11],
)

oracle = SlidingPuzzle.precompute(goal_state)
```

You can then write the result to a file:

```ruby
oracle.write("path/to/file")
```

And read it in later:

```ruby
oracle = SlidingPuzzle.read("path/to/file")

start_state = SlidingPuzzle.new(
  [1, 5,  2,  3],
  [4, 0,  6,  7],
  [8, 9, 10, 11],
)

oracle.solve(start_state)
#=> [:down, :right]
```

For puzzles with greater than 12 tiles, you won't be able to precompute an
oracle in a reasonable amount of time. The 4x4 puzzle will take more than 40,000
times longer to precompute than the 3x4 puzzle and require terrabytes of RAM.
The `debug` flag will reveal if it's ever likely to finish:


```ruby
SlidingPuzzle.precompute(goal_state, debug: true)
# queue size: 1
# queue size: 2
# queue size: 3
# ...
```

If it just keeps growing, it's unlikely to finish.

### Other methods ###

There are a few other methods that may be useful:

```ruby
# Get the number on the first row and second column:
puzzle.get(0, 1)
#=> 5

#Â Find the row and column of the number 5:
puzzle.find(5)
#=> [0, 1]

# Return a clone of the array of tiles:
puzzle.tiles
#=> [[1, 5,  2,  3], [4, 0,  6,  7], [8, 9, 10, 11]]

# Return a clone of the puzzle:
puzzle.clone
#=> #<SlidingPuzzle:object_id>
```

### Ideas to try ###

I hope you have fun with this gem. Here are some things to try:

1) Find an algorithm to solve a puzzle without using an oracle
2) Compare the number of moves your algorithm makes with the oracle
3) Write a web server for interacting with sliding puzzles
4) Read

5) Write a user interface to slide tiles around
